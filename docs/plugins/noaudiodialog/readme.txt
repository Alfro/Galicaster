Dialog warning that the audio is too low
========================================

If this plugin is active, a dialog will pop up, warning the audio level is too low. This dialog is only shown in the recording screen. It is useful for the lecturers to notice the state of Galicaster easily, or to let them have a warning when there are problems with the microphone.

When the audio is recovered, the dialog disappears. If necessary, it can also be closed manually.


To activate/deactivate this warning:

[plugins]
noaudiodialog = True
